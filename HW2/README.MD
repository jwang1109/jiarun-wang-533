To help you get started, use the code posted on the HW2 channel in Teams. I've also heavily modified the slides we used in class last week and added those on Teams as well -- they will help you a lot, plus they include some basic worked examples of blotter entries that you can use to check yourself. 
To help you get started, use the code posted on the HW2 channel in Teams. I've also heavily modified the slides we used in class last week and added those on Teams as well -- they will help you a lot, plus they include some basic worked examples of blotter entries that you can use to check yourself. 

You have two weeks to do this task. That's two full class meetings to ask questions and discuss, in addition to the Teams channel, so you should have ample time to get this sorted out. 

You may work in teams of no more than 3 to accomplish this task.

When finished, your app should work as follows:

1. When the user clicks "Query Refinitiv", then the app should pull data from Refinitiv for the asset specified in Asset and for the date range given in the date range (just like in HW1). Feel free to play around with different assets but we'll be using IVV to check your answers for grading.

2. When the user updates any of the n or alpha values, the blotter should update itself to reflect the new parameters. You may choose to add an additional "submit" button for this task, or you may choose to have the blotter update immediately whenever the user changes an input -- your call. The blotter should include exit orders!

3. I've left an empty column to the right of to the controls section on the webpage (i've marked it in the comments). There, I want you to upload an image that contains a drawing of the Reactive Graph for your app. You can make in PowerPoint like I did, you can draw it with a whiteboard app, use MS Paint, or even draw it on a real-life whiteboard, take a picture of it, and put that picture in your app. They're all ok.

4. Put your names somewhere in the app, maybe as an HTML heading somewhere.

 

You can add as many new elements, widgets, and text to the app as you think you need. You can add as much color & styling as your heart desires, but you'll be graded on the accuracy of the ledger.

I have zero problem with it if you use Teams to check each other's answers.

Post all questions on the Teams channel and happy hunting! Mastering the art of Blotter is a worthwhile undertaking.

 

To submit, choose someone on your team to upload your app file to this assignment, and link me to the Git repo that hosts the version you want to be graded.
