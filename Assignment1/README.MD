Notes:
For 2), I used a placeholder parameter to function as a LABEL. After a user clears all the contents in an Input bar, they can view the label of that bar.


Assignment Requirements:

Alter the app.py file shared in Class 3 Directory in the following ways: 

1) Add a start date & end date filter for your benchmark and asset data batch fetch so that you only query refinitiv for that date range.

2) Add a LABEL to the 'benchmark' and 'asset' text inputs on your webpage so that your user can tell which is which.

3) Add another start date & end date filter for your PLOT that will only plot data points within the specified date range. 

--> to do 1 and 3, you should definitely use something like this: https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/datepickerrange

4) Add another callback function that runs when the plot output changes. This callback should extract what alpha and beta are from the plot object (the ols trendline) and display this information on your webpage in a way that you think is most appropriate.

 

I will be posting further guidance and video modules on this but I advise you to:

==> USE MICROSOFT TEAMS

==> USE GOOGLE AND USE EACH OTHER AS RESOURCES
